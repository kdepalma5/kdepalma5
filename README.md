# 📂 Projects
## [🛠️ Mastercard Credit Card Customer Churn Model](https://github.com/jkyc38/teammastercard)
- Developed machine learning models to predict customer churn for Mastercard, achieving high accuracy and recall.
- Conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis with visualizations to uncover key insights.
- Preprocessed data: addressed missing values, outliers, and one-hot encoded features.
- Engineered features to optimize model performance.
- Implemented and fine-tuned algorithms including Random Forest, Hist Gradient Boosting Classifier, XGBoost, and more.

## [🏠 Airbnb Accommodation Prediction Model](https://github.com/kdepalma5/Airbnb_ML_Project)
- Predicted guest capacity using NYC Airbnb listings data with models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Stacking Regressor, Gradient Boosted Trees, and Random Forest.
- Achieved strong results: RMSE = 0.99, R² = 0.72.

## [💡Updated patentr Package](https://github.com/kdepalma5/patentr_updated)
- Extension to JYProys patentr R package
- Build a dataset of over 3 million patents (2014–2024) for a machine learning algorithm designed to identify AI-related patents in the USPTO database.
- Automated extraction of 22 types of metadata for each patent from the USPTO patent database using R, including downloading weekly ZIP files and consolidating data into CSV files by extending the patentr R package.
- Engineered a mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive AI taxonomy for classifying patents that achieved an interrater reliability of 0.922, ensuring highly consistent and accurate patent categorization.
